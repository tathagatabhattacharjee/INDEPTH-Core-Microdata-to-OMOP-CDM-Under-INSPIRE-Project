**INDEPTH Core Microdata to OMOP CDM Conversion (INSPIRE Project)**

This repository provides tools, guidelines, and resources for mapping INDEPTH Core Microdata to the **OMOP CDM 5.4** structure as part of the INSPIRE Project. By integrating demographic surveillance data with clinical data in a standardized format, this effort aims to enhance data harmonization, interoperability, and population health research.

This repository was used for writing the paper:
**INSPIRE datahub: a pan-African integrated suite of services for harmonising longitudinal population health data using OHDSI tools**
(January 2024, Frontiers in Digital Health 6:3, DOI:10.3389/fdgth.2024.1329630)

**Introduction**
The INDEPTH Core Microdata contains rich demographic surveillance information that requires transformation into the OMOP CDM format for compatibility with analytical tools such as **ATLAS** and integration with global health data platforms. This project focuses on enabling standardized data analysis for population health researchers.

**Project Goals
**
Map INDEPTH Core Microdata to OMOP CDM v5.4 using Rabbit-in-a-Hat, WhiteRabbit, and Usagi.

Implement Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes using Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) for efficient data transformation.

Ensure data consistency, accuracy, and traceability throughout the transformation process.

Provide comprehensive documentation for users to understand the mapping logic and processes.
