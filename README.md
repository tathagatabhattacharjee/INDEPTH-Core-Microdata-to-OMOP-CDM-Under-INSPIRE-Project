INDEPTH Core Microdata to OMOP CDM Conversion (INSPIRE Project)

This repository provides tools, guidelines, and resources for mapping INDEPTH Core Microdata to the OMOP CDM 5.4 structure as part of the INSPIRE Project. This effort aims to enhance data harmonization, interoperability, and facilitate population health research by integrating demographic surveillance data with clinical data in a standardized format.

This repository was used for writing the paper:
INSPIRE datahub: a pan-African integrated suite of services for harmonising longitudinal population health data using OHDSI tools
